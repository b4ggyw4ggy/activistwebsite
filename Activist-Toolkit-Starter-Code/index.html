        <strong><p class="home"> On April 23, 2021, Yao Pan Ma, a Chinese immigrant, was brutally attacked, only while collecting cans in East Harlem. He died at the age of 61  trying to provide for his family. On March 16, 2021, the Atlanta Spa Shootings occurred. Six out of the eight people killed were Asian women. They were daughters, mothers, sisters, and most importantly they were people . Now, in 2022, things have just escalated even more. On January 15, 2022, Michelle Alyssa Go, a 40 year old Asian American woman was pushed onto the train track of a New York subway car. These are just 3 of the 9,000 reported asian hate crimes since the pandemic began.</p></strong>

        <strong><p class="home"> Hate crimes are being criminally underreported and law enforcement lacks the skill and resources to spot and report to the FBI. Second, a language barrier has formed between the victims and the US government. With the language barrier, more conflict is put on Asian Americans to describe the event and blur the lines between if it was or was not a hate crime</p></strong>

        <strong><p class="home">Allyship is about sharing power, it is not meant to be a comfortable or easy ride. Being an ally to any social movements means that you are ready to change those things no matter if it subtracts some cost of your own comfortability. Parts of society that may work well for you, may not work well for other people. You have to face the fact that some people are more comfortable with the way things are now because it does not affect them. You have to be actively trying to change these things, even if it is at the expense of your own comfort. </p></strong>
