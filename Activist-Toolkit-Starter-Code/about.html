  <strong><p>My Anh and Bridget want to inform the world of the increase in AAPI Hate after the pandemic. We wanted to highlight the many victims affected by these hate crimes by bringing light to the more recent ones during the 2021 Quarantine. Hate crimes toward the Asian minority are still active to this day, and our goal is to have people connect and be able to help the families. We wish to bring togetherness and spread awareness about Asian hate crimes for the minority that is unrecognized by the majority. 
</p></strong>
  <strong><p> 
  As our communities have suffered through the pandemic, we wish to spread awareness and highlight those who need it the most. Together we can take action, not just to help our community but to help others as well. Take action by clicking the take action button on the navigation bar. </p></strong>
